# Imprint

#### [__Imprint__](https://project-imprint.herokuapp.com/) is a business card collector and organizer that features dynamically displayed and updated information.

### Why Business Cards
Business cards are fundamental pieces of social interactions amongst the employed population. From office workers to stockbrokers, a chance encounter usually means an exchange of cards will punctuate the interaction. And yet, these stylish yet subtle slices of a person’s professional information can get lost easily when you accrue dozens of them over the course of a work week. 
Our mission is to create an app in which a user needs only to place another business card into the frame of their smartphone’s camera before a brief scan transfers all the information from the card to the app. All the information such as the card owner’s name, company name, and contact information will be neatly organized and displayed through Imprint and ready to be viewed with ease.

## How Does It Work

### Application Features
- Create unique and secured user profiles
- Add new business cards
- Browse all stored business cards
- View dynamic information of each card
- Edit, update, and delete new business card information

### Planned Additional Features
- Business card scanning method:
    - Text recognition for specific inputs? (i.e. email address automatically gets logged into the field 'email address)
    - Generic business card template for easier b. text recognition?
- Generating personal business card:
    - Unique QR code based on registered user for fluid info exchange
- Business card categorizing / filtering strategies:
    - Customize filtering parameter (i.e. business type, alphabetical order, date added, connection type)
    - Additional filtering groups for company uses (project, contractor, invester, etc.)
- Importing contacts from existing apps (i.e. phone contacts)
- Exporting / sharing business cards with others
